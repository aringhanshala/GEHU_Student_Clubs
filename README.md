## Introduction  
In today’s fast-paced academic environment, extracurricular activities play a vital role in student development. However, many colleges, including ours, lack a dedicated platform for managing club-related activities on their official websites. This creates challenges such as:  
- Difficulty in discovering clubs and their activities.  
- Inefficient communication between clubs and students.  
- Limited student engagement in events.  

To address these challenges, we propose the **Centralized Club Management System**, a one-stop platform integrated within the college website. This system aims to enhance communication, streamline processes, and foster a vibrant campus community.
